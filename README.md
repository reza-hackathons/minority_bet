Minority Bet Zoo
==================

Minority Bet Zoo is a binary betting game that challenges participants's strategis to make interesting choices in order to win. It simply asks users to stake some near tokens, choose a party, and finally wait for the winners to be chosen and rewards distribution.

Each betting session runs for 55 minutes and then there is a 5 minute cooldown period when the lucky winners are chosen and reward payouts are made. Betting starts when the minute handle of the blockchain is >= 0 and ends when the handle reaches 56. Users have a chance to make a bet and pullout as long as the session is alive.

The strange rules of this game makes it difficult for large players to make a 51% attack. If one decides to influence the game, she ought to sacrifices significnt amounts.
